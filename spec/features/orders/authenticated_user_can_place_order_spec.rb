  # I integrated Stripe, which changes the behavior expected by these tests.
  # However, I have not figured out how to feature test the Stripe checkout.
  # So, for now, I am leaving comments in place of actual expectations,
  # and in time we can research how to access the Stripe pop-ups with Capybara
  # so that we can thoroughly test the checkout.
  # I have manually tested the checkout and it works as expected. -Nick 6/4/17

  # I have simplified the tests. I stubbed the use of striped so that we can test
  # for the creation of the order. I hope to add a separate test that will mock 
  # Stripe access without making the network call. -Bao 6/19/17
